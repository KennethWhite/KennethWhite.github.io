Introduction
============

Purpose
-------

>Product: Assisted Living Facility Inspection Scheduler Version 0.1

>The purpose of this Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is to
detail the product in its entirety; From requirements the software will
incorporate, to the specifications we will use to implement the
requirements, the validation tests that will be used to ensure each
requirement is implemented, and the verification tests that
specifications were followed.

Document Conventions
--------------------

>There is no particular priority associated with the order features are
listed, however higher level headings are the primary objective to which
the nested headings contribute to or elaborate on.

>In general the headings will be designated in bold as a period separated
list in the following format as applicable: Section . Subsection .
(Requirement/Specification/Validation)

Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
-----------------------------------------

 >This document is primarily intended for use by the project developers,
however Sections 1 and 2 are applicable for any reader as they detail
the purpose and high-level details of this project.

>**Users**: May specifically find Sections 2.2, 2.6 and Section 4 helpful
in seeing a listing of what functions the product can perform. In
particular, 2.6 details where to find the complete user documentation.

>**Troubleshooting**: Section 2, Section 3 and Section 5 may assist in
troubleshooting issues with the software.

>**Developers:** Sections 1 and 2 will provide an overview of the
project, Sections 3 and 4 will specify the features of the product.

Mission Statement
-----------------

>Our mission is to make the scheduling of Assisted Living Facility
inspections an advantage to Washington DSHS and not a burden. Our goal
is to provide a flexible software solution to help organize and automate
this work so that they may better focus on their own mission of support
and safety.

>The product's primary purpose is to automatically generate inspection
schedules for ALF facilities. The software is also intended provide an
improved and intuitive interface over the currently used Excel
spreadsheets, while maintaining the portability of the Excel file
format.

Overall Description
===================

Product Perspective
-------------------

>This SRS specifies a new self-contained product that aims to improve
upon the current use of Excel to track and schedule ALF inspections. It
is a client based system wrapping Excel files with a MVC application for
Windows. Once an ALF facility has been inspected, the results are
entered into the application, which is responsible for scheduling any
necessary follow up inspections as well as the next compliance
inspection in approximately 13-15 months.

Product Functions
-----------------

>The primary function of this application is to automate the scheduling
of the ALF inspections; Thus the information entered by the user is used
to prioritize and generate subsequent inspections for the facility.

>The application will allow users to read in data from an existing Excel
file and perform any of the following functions:

>-   View the data in a concise manner

>-   Edit existing data, or add new entries

>-   Sort, search and filter the data

>-   Manually adjust inspection dates

>-   Export/print data on specific facilities

Operating Environment
---------------------

>This software is targeted towards the Windows platform, supporting the
following operating systems.

>  Windows Version   Supported Editions
>  ----------------- --------------------
                    
>  Windows 10        32-bit and 64-bit
>  Windows 8         32-bit and 64-bit

>*Source:* \[2\] MSDN .Net Framework System Requirements

 Design and Implementation Constraints
--------------------------------------

>There are a number of limitations the software must accommodate. This
software will not have access to the customer's database, and so it is
designed around importing and exporting the data to and from Excel
files. For this reason, the software is built around using the .Net
Framework's Interoperability library. The data the software will work
with is sensitive in nature, so as a security consideration this
software will not have any internet or network connectivity.

User Documentation
------------------

>This will be completed after the software has been finished.

Assumptions and Dependencies
----------------------------

>There are a number of assumptions in regards to this project and its
requirements that are subject to change as the project progresses.

>-   The application will only need to target Windows operating systems.
>-   The Interoperability library the software will use requires the
    client machines have a copy of Excel installed.

External Interface Requirements
===============================

User Interfaces
---------------

>\<Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the
software product and the users. This may include sample screen images,
any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be
followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions
(e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error
message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for
which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design
should be documented in a separate user interface specification.\>

>This will be completed at a future point when we have considered the GUI
design and spoken more with the client.

Software Interfaces
-------------------

>The application will rely upon Excel 2008 or later, and work with .xls
files in order to maintain the current product. The C\# Interoperabilty
library relies upon an existing installation of Excel in order to
manipulate .xls files. Built-in functions of the Excel application will
be called through the C\# library, such as adding, removing, sorting and
modifying rows, cells, and columns.

>In addition, as an optional feature we are considering adding support
for storing or exporting the data to a SQL database, time permitting. If
we do choose to implement such features, we will update this document
with the specifications.
